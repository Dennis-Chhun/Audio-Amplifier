# Audio-Amplifier
Dual channel, low-impedance amplifier that will strengthen low power, inaudible electronic audio signals.

Utilized bridge rectifiers and linear voltage regulators to power two AD797N Integrated Circuits.

Two AD797 Integrated Circuits were used to create a left and right channel for noise minimization.

Used Eagle for schematic capture and PCB layout.
